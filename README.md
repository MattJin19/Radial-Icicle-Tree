# Radial-Icicle-Tree (RIT)
A brief tutorial for paper "Radial Icicle Tree (RIT): Node Separation and Area Constancy"

The **Radial Icicle Tree (RIT)**, which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector
while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied this new visual design to some dataset.
