# Radial-Icicle-Tree (RIT)
A brief tutorial for paper "Radial Icicle Tree (RIT): Node Separation and Area Constancy"

The **Radial Icicle Tree (RIT)**, which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector
while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied this new visual design to some datasets.

## Overview
Currently, we have made four tutorial files to illustrate the design ideas in the paper. The **Tutorial I** document shows what a synthetic data looks like under the RIT diagram. 
The **Tutorial II** document explains how to draw more layers of RIT on the basis of **Tutorial I**. The **Tutorial III** and **Tutorial IV** are the applications of RIT on two public datasets.
