# Radial-Icicle-Tree (RIT)
A brief tutorial for paper "Radial Icicle Tree (RIT): Node Separation and Area Constancy"

The **Radial Icicle Tree (RIT)**, which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector
while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied this new visual design to some datasets. 

Currently, we have made four tutorial files to illustrate the design ideas in the paper. T
he Tutorial I document shows what a synthetic data looks like under the RIT diagram. 
The Tutorial II document explains how to draw more layers of RIT on the basis of Tutorial I. 
Tutorial III and Tutorial IV are the applications of RIT on two public datasets.
